        Let me help you practice this question in Chinese. Let me first provide you with the essential vocabulary:

        | English | Chinese (Characters) | Pronunciation (Pinyin) |
        |---------|---------------------|----------------------|
        | what | 什么 | shénme |
        | time | 点 | diǎn |
        | is | 是 | shì |
        | now/current | 现在 | xiànzài |

        For this question, you should know that in Chinese:
        - We typically start time questions with 现在 (now/current)
        - The word order is slightly different from English
        - We use 几 (jǐ) for asking "what" specifically when referring to numbers/time

        Please try to write the Chinese translation for "What time is it?"
